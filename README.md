# automateforgood
This is created for the Chef Automateforgood hackathon.

## What it does 
The automation we built will create EC2 VMs and install Chef client software. The chef client will get initiated and the VM will get added automatically to chef server as a chef node. Once the VM get registered with Chef, the mandatory softwares, configurations listed in the PowerShell script will get executed in the VM and make the VM complaint to the organisation requirement.
